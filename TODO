* automake file

libgrowl
=====

* (x) [gntp_return_error] When server reply with error, shows what is the error.

* (x) feature: return the fail reason from GNTP in debug level 1:
eg. Required header missing (Notification-Title)

* (x) output case 1: case 2: with -v(verbose) only
      message 'port hard code' ot 'host hard code'

* (x) Retrieve platform name and version.
    ( ) use uname command for Linux, just a temporary solution. uname retrieve the kernal name not platform name.

* (x) cmocka/bsd_get_platform_name_test.c
  test case fail, because before macOS product name has changed from 'Mac OS X' to 'Mac OS'
  $ sw_vers -productNam
  High Sierra:'Mac OS X'
  Big Sur: 'macOS'
  Solution: 
  1. implement _macOS in compile time?
  $ ./config.guess 
  ==> i386-apple-darwin20.6.0
  2. accept 'Mac OS X' or 'macOS' as results
    assert_true(strcmp("macOS",platform_name)==0 || strcmp("Mac OS X",platform_name)==0);

* (x) [change_host] Can change ip and port

* (x) Can use machine name as ip eg. "localhost" to replace '127.0.0.1"

* ( ) send url link

* ( ) send icon/picture (gntp-send can send image)
    $ gntp-send 'title' 'message' [Growl.png]

* document for developer to setup Growl environment (Mac, Linux, Windows)

* ( ) notification type (eg. download complete)
Note: follow libgrowl(java) NotificationType.java
A notification type groups all the similar notifications of your application.
eg. you may need a "download started" and "download finished" notification

* ( ) support password

* (x) add debian package in Makefile
      (x) add checksum

* (x) pkg-config.pc

* ( ) Makefile install -d /usr/local/lib ==> /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

* (v) Doxygen.
  add doxygen config file.
  add @file at the beginning of the file to be appeared in doxygen eg.
  /**
   * @file libgrowl.c
   * @author hooichee<fuyichin@gmail.com>
   */

* ( ) Fix the testing script cmocka/run_unit_test.sh
for prog in $1 ==> for prog in $@

* ( ) Fix Readme.md
  '==>' unable to be processed by Latex (for Linux pandoc) to convert to PDF
  use $ sed to sed s/\⇒/==>/ README.md1
  add ``` to the program code
  consider adding the below

* ( ) add CFLAGS in all Makefiles (src example cmocka) 
  eg. in Linux compiler doesn't includes -D_LINUX, results error
  $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS)

* ( ) use CC ?= gcc in Makefile. for $ CC="tcc" make

* ( ) remove warning when compile in Linux
  eg. libgrowl.c:397:16: warning: assignment to ‘FILE *’, 
      stdoutFile = popen(cmd, "r") ;
  remove '-ansi' compiler option from gcc

growlnotify
=====

* (x) print help message

VSCode

* 'libgrowl.h' file not found, not configured properly (extension:C/C++ Clang Command Adapter aka clangd)
