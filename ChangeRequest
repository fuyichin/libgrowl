[x] cr1. cmocka. bsd_get_platform_name_test fail. A different platform name on Big Sur 11.6.
  description: The platform name retrieve from sw_vers has changed to 'macOS' since Mac OS 11, compare with the previous 'Mac OS X'
  solution: to implement -D_macOS in compile time?
cr2. document. Fix Readme.md file for Linux pandoc Latex. '==>'
  Still working if output with othe application.
cr3. cmocka. run_unit_test.sh only process the first parameter
[x] cr4. cmocka. CFLAGS not inlcuded in the compile for libgrowl.c
libgrowl.o: ../src/libgrowl.c
	$(CC) -c ../src/libgrowl.c -I../src  # <== missing CFLAGS 
[x] cr5. review TODO, add new solutions. eg. check platform name in test case.
